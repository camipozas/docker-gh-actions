# What is Docker?
It is a software platform that allows you to quickly build, test, and deploy applications.

- üì¶ **Packages** Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that include everything needed for the software to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.
- üê≥ **Container** Really allows us to encapsulate, that is, pack software inside said container using the microservices architecture.

# Process of creating a container in Docker

In addition, it is necessary to clarify that within the container a series of instructions **(dockerfile)** are defined that allow creating an image **(docker image)** with which to start said container **(docker container)**.[^1]

1. üê≥ **Dockerfile:** it is the text document on which we can group a series of commands so that they are all executed at the same time, thus avoiding having to execute them one by one manually so that the process of creating a Docker image is much easier. faster and more efficient.
2. üñºÔ∏è **Docker image:** a Docker image, contains the libraries, along with the application code that contains everything necessary to run our application.
3. üì¶ **Container:** It is a Docker image when it starts working, that is, when it comes to life.
